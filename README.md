# Graft

_Massively Maintainable GraphQL_

## Overview

Graft is a set of companion libraries for [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/), offering opinionated tools for working with PostGraphile's outstanding [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) + [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) solution in an efficient and easy-to-maintain way.

Graft is built to be easily overridden, and you don't have to use convenience wrappers like `withGraft` if you'd like more control over your configuration.

It is currently in the early stages, evolving a usable developer API.

## Server Tools

For information on Graft's tools for implementing a GraphQL server with an auto-generated core based on your PostgreSQL database, take a look at the [@graft/server](packages/server) package.

## Client Tools

For information on Graft's (currently sparse) tools for integrating with a client app, visit the [@graft/client](packages/client) package.
